## Software-based image compression

Module for testing different image compression algorithms. For now we have a JPEG compression code. 

### Requires

For Windows:
```
easy_install Pillow
```

For Linux:
```
sudo pip install Pillow
```

For Mac:
```
brew install libtiff libjpeg webp littlecms

### Instructions

Run testimage.py. This takes the input image (testimage.jpg) and compresses it (testimage_compressed.jpg)
